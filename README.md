# BlackFriday-Sales-Data-Regression-Analysis-Python

In this project, we analyze and predict the sales during Black Friday, and display the results through graph plots and different prediction models.

The dataset encompasses sales transactions within a retail company, sourced from Kaggle. This classic dataset serves as a valuable resource for honing feature engineering skills using Python.

The primary focus of the project revolves around a regression problem. A model has been developed to anticipate the Purchase Amount of customers based on various products. This predictive capability aids the company in tailoring personalized offers to customers for different products.
